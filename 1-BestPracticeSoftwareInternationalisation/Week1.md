## A dire need for information

"Very often, young rural mothers lack access to health and nutritional guidelines in their language, so they cannot combat malnutrition in their children.

According to the former director of UNICEF,
James Grant,
two billion people today
lack access to healthcare.

**As a result, 17 million people die each year
and 80% of these preventable deaths
occur
because of a lack of access to healthcare information."**
